# Rfid-Door-Lock
We need to download the MFRC522



Hey there! it's Aryan Verma this side. 
Today I will be talking about my fourth project. 
This project is based on rfid door locks. 
The tools used in this car are Arduino uno, rfid tags, servo, led display and some wire and jumpers.  
I will be adding some more cool features in this car and yeah you all are open to write some improvement's points on this system. 
This will boost me up and help me in making more projects like this.
